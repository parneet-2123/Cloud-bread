# Problem Statement

Food waste is a significant issue in our world today. Every year, billions of pounds of food are thrown away while millions go hungry. This is not only a moral issue but also an environmental one, as food waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and other negative impacts on our planet. At the same time, many restaurants and banquet halls struggle with excess food at the end of the day. This food is often still safe to eat but may not be able to be sold or served the next day. As a result, it usually ends up in the trash. We saw this as an opportunity to make a difference. By connecting food banks and restaurants or banquet halls we can help reduce food waste and provide meals to those in need. Our platform, Cloud Bread, was created to address this problem and help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.

# Solution

We saw this as an opportunity to make a difference. By connecting food banks and restaurants, we can help reduce food waste and provide meals to those in need. The food is further divided into three parts.. 1. edible food is donated 2. rotten food is decomposed to make soil which is further sold to farmers at a cheap price 3. Vegetable peels are converted to make paper.. ex:- 5 vegetable peels are converted to make 1 paper.. Our platform, Cloud Bread, was created to address this problem and help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.
